## Revolution+ watchface

This is a slightly modified version of Douwe Maan's Revolution watchface for the Pebble, featuring a more subtle vibration every hour, and a quicker (and in my opinion, slicker) animation.

Envisioned as a watchface by Jean-NoÃ«l Mattern (Jnm), who posted it in the ["Watch-face ideas" thread](http://forums.getpebble.com/discussion/comment/3538/#Comment_3538) on the Pebble forums.

Originally based on the display of the [Freebox Revolution](http://www.free.fr/adsl/freebox-revolution.html), which was designed by Philippe Starck.

Much like the original, different versions are available if you don't like the hourly vibration, or if you use the American 'MM/DD' date format.
